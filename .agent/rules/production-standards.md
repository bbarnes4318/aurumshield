You are writing production-grade code for a sovereign financial infrastructure platform.

NON-NEGOTIABLE EXECUTION RULES:

1. No pseudo-code.
2. No placeholder comments like “implement later.”
3. If functionality must be stubbed, it must:
   - Compile
   - Render
   - Be explicitly labeled TODO
   - Have a defined interface
4. Every page must compile and render using mock data.
5. No broken imports.
6. No incomplete components.
7. All pages must be navigable.
8. All forms must validate using Zod.
9. All async data must use TanStack Query with mock endpoints.
10. If an assumption is required, list it explicitly and proceed.
11. If the task prompt specifies libraries/architecture, you must follow it exactly and not substitute alternatives.

The output must be production-ready and internally consistent.
