Context: Part A: Marketplace UI/UX Critique & Analytics
Buyer Perspective
The current Marketplace (src/app/marketplace/page.tsx and AssetCard.tsx) presents a luxury, card-based feed of gold allocations
. Each Asset Card shows form (bar/coin), purity, total weight, premium and price per oz, and vault location
. There are two dropdown filters (Form, Vault) and a summary strip of aggregate metrics
. While the design is clean, several friction points emerge:

Filtering & Discovery: Only two filters (form and vault) may be too coarse for sophisticated buyers. Users might want price range, weight range, or keyword search. The current UI lacks sorting options (e.g. by price, premium, weight) and a search bar, forcing manual scanning. Analytics should track each filter change (FilterChip onChange) and “Clear Filters” clicks
 to identify preferred filters and unmet needs.

Price Transparency: The card displays premium and price/oz, but without context. Buyers might not know the current spot price or why the premium is what it is. We should surface the real-time spot price (e.g. via OANDA) next to each listing or in the header. Trust patterns suggest clear, unambiguous information reduces cognitive load
. For example, showing "Spot $2020/oz" as a reference and labeling "+$X premium/oz" explicitly would improve clarity.

Trust Signals: Currently, trust cues are subtle: the header tagline “Vault-verified inventory · Settlement-gated · Premium pricing”
 hints at safety. To increase trust, we should add explicit badges/icons on cards: e.g. Assay Verified, LBMA Good Delivery, or Fully Insured. If evidence is incomplete, an icon could show “Document Missing”. Seller identity or KYC status could also be indicated (e.g. “Verified Seller” badge). According to fintech UX principles, consistent visuals and security cues (lock icons, badges) reinforce credibility
.

Cognitive Load: The card contains many data points and small text. We should simplify the hierarchy. For example, use larger typography for weight (as already done) and collapse less critical info behind hover/tooltips or a detail view (progressive disclosure). The current filter bar could also be streamlined (e.g. a single “Filter” modal or accordion). As one fintech design guide notes, structured layouts with whitespace reduce cognitive load
. Consistent spacing and fewer simultaneous inputs will make scanning easier.

Checkout & Price Lock: The two-step checkout (StepOnePriceLock.tsx and StepTwoRouting.tsx) creates urgency with a 60-second countdown
. This can induce anxiety (“countdown effect”). To reduce pressure, we should soften or hide the ticking clock. Possible changes: remove the red/amber warning colors (or reduce to neutral gray), provide an explicit “Why lock?” explanation, and allow the user to pause/extend once (progressive disclosure of risk). Alternative flows (like “Add to cart” instead of immediate lock) could also be considered. Fintech UX emphasizes simplicity in complex flows and giving the user control
.

Seller Perspective
The Seller Dashboard consists of a two-column layout: a main column with summary cards, published listings, and settlement activity; and a right rail showing draft readiness
. The Listing Wizard (at /sell/page.tsx) is a 3-step process (Specs, Evidence, Publish)
. Key observations and improvements:

Listing Creation Flow: The 3-step wizard is a good use of progressive disclosure (spec first, then evidence, then review). We should ensure each step is as frictionless as possible. For instance, Step 1 auto-saves a draft
, which is great. Step 2 requires uploading exactly 3 documents. We could improve feedback by immediately validating uploads (e.g. “Assay report looks valid”) and possibly allow drag-and-drop. If evidence OCR fails, give actionable error. Step 3 shows the publish gate results
; we should make those blocker messages clearer (e.g. “Missing Assay Report” instead of raw codes), which the code already partially does via formatBlockerLabel
. Visualizing those block reasons (perhaps with icons) can guide sellers to fix issues quickly.

Inventory Management: The My Listings table (/sell/listings/page.tsx) lists all drafts and published items with status badges
. It’s functional but could use richer controls: add a search bar or filters (similar to the buyer’s view) so sellers can quickly find a specific listing or status. Allow inline editing of price or weight for quick adjustments. Bulk actions (e.g. select multiple listings to suspend or delete) would streamline management. Summaries like “Total inventory value” are shown in summary cards
 – these can be expanded into interactive charts (e.g. bar graph of holdings by weight or value) to give sellers visual analytics.

Atomic Buy Tracking: If buyers can reserve partial quantities, sellers need visibility. Currently, published listing cards show status (Available/Reserved/Sold)
, but not how much weight is remaining versus reserved. We should display a progress bar or fraction (e.g. “12 of 50 oz remaining”) on each listing tile. This provides immediate insight into inventory levels. Tracking conversions means logging each reservation/order: analytics events for “Listing Reserved” and “Listing Sold” with weights would let sellers see conversion rates over time.

Pricing Spreads: The UI does not currently support dynamic pricing or spreads. We could introduce a feature where sellers set an array of price-per-oz thresholds (e.g. tiered pricing for different weight slices) and see a small chart of price vs. weight. Even simpler, an inline chart showing historical spot vs. listing price (or premium) would let sellers gauge competitiveness. At minimum, allow sellers to easily update their price to rebalance spreads, perhaps by editing the listing and seeing market spot for reference.

Seller Dashboard Analytics: Track internal UI events: e.g. which step a user abandons in the listing wizard, how long they spend uploading evidence, etc. Key events: “Draft Created”, “Evidence Uploaded”, “Publish Attempt (allowed/blocked)”. Instrument the ListingReadinessRail cards (e.g. if a seller clicks “Continue Editing” to fix blockers). These data points help refine the workflow. For example, if many sellers stall at Step 2, it signals the upload UI may need improvement.

Analytics & Telemetry Plan
To continually optimize the marketplace UX, we must instrument critical interactions on both buyer and seller sides. Recommended events and metrics include:

Buyer-Side Events:

Filter Usage: Capture when users change any filter (form or vault) or clear all filters. Log filter values and resulting listing count to identify popular queries.
Listing Views & Reserves: Track when an AssetCard enters the viewport and when “Reserve Asset” is clicked, along with listingId and weight chosen. This shows which assets draw interest and lead conversions.
Checkout Progress:
Record when the checkout modal opens (CheckoutModalWrapper mount) and closes.
In Step 1: track weight input changes and “Lock Price & Continue” clicks. If the countdown expires, log a “PriceLockExpired” event.
Time-to-Price-Lock: measure duration from modal open to lock click. This highlights friction (long times or timeouts).
In Step 2: track delivery method selection, address entry, and “Slide to Execute” actions. Log partial drag attempts and successful slide completions or reverts.
Abandonment: if the user closes checkout or navigates away at any point, log that stage as a drop-off.
Hesitation Metrics: Measure dwell time on key components (filter panel, price lock form) and repeated changes (e.g. toggling filters on/off) to quantify confusion or indecision.
Seller-Side Events:

Listing Wizard: Log each step completion (Step 1 Completed, Step 2 Completed, etc.), including any validation errors. Track time spent per step to spot slowdowns.
Publish Gate: Log “Publish Attempt” with outcome (allowed or blocked and blocker reasons). Count how often each blocker appears.
Listings Dashboard: Track interactions like sorting or searching (if added), edits to listings, and clicks on readiness cards.
Inventory Actions: Events for creating a draft listing, uploading each evidence doc, and publishing. Also track cancellations (if a seller abandons creation).
User Flow Metrics: Funnel analysis from “New Listing initiated” → “Published” to calculate conversion rate, and drop-offs in the wizard.
Telemetry Tools: Integrate a modern analytics library (e.g. PostHog or Vercel Analytics) by initializing it on the client and invoking posthog.capture() (or similar) on the above events. For example, add event handlers in React components (e.g. on filter change, on button clicks) that send descriptive events. Use user attributes (role=seller/buyer) and distinct IDs to correlate behavior. This data will feed dashboards and experiments to optimize UI flows.
